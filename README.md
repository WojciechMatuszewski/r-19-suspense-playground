# Suspense enabled "Search pokemon" app

The goal was to learn a bit more about some of the APIs coming to React 19.

- The `use` hook.

- The `useActionState` hook.

- Loading images via `use` hook.

In addition, I wanted to dip my toes in the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API).

## Learnings

- It seems like the `v7_startTransition: true` on the router does not do what I want.

  - While it will suspend route transitions, it will also make it so the UI "lags" in places when I update the `searchParams`.

    - This is not what I want. I want to be fully in control of that.

    - Having said that, this is the behavior React documentation recommends.

- When using the `action` on a form, the component rendering that form did not update its JSX until all the _Suspended_ components resolved. Why?

  - The [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic#use) mentions that one should use `useOptimistic` to display a _different_ state while _async action_ is underway.

    - I'm confused since the action I'm performing is NOT async â€“ it changes query parameters on the URL.

  - I **think it is because the `form` is no longer a "simple" HTML tag, but rather a complex component**.

    - [This blog post](https://jser.dev/2024-03-20-how-does-useoptimisticwork-internally-in-react/#44-form-now-accepts-async-action) appears to confirm my suspicion. **The form will "hold" the old inner JSX until the action is resolved**.

      > <form/> accepts an async action, when it is submitted, <form/> will have a new state hook internally, and a global transition is started for the async action until it is completed.

    Since React's update granularity is per component, React will keep the component's "old" JSX that renders the `form` tag.

- How do I show pending UI in completely unrelated part of the app when submitting a form via `action`?

  - I **did not find any other way than moving the `useActionState` to the parent**.

  - I do not like this pattern. What if I had a ton of stuff in-between the form and the component displaying the data?

    - On the other hand, the `form` acts as a `Context.Provider`. If I want the state from the `Context.Provider` in my component, the `Context.Provider` has to wrap that component.

- To enable the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) I had to use the `createBrowserRouter` function.

  - The `BrowserRouter` component does not support that API.

  - The defaults of the _View Transitions API_ are very good. The cross-fade effect adds a lot of fluidity to the page.

- Use the `view-transition-name` on an element to tell the browser it should "move" in-between screens.

  - This is quite amazing. With a single line of CSS, I can create animations that previously required a lot of code.

  - You have everything you need to craft really elaborate animations since you can directly configure the `animation` property used for the transition.
